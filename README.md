# MED5018_Group5

This repository contains the final project of Group 5 for the MED5018 course at the Southern University of Science and Technology. The team members are Chen XiYue, Liu Yuchen, Liu Chunfa, and Yang Huanning.

## Project Overview
The project aims to investigate the relationship between cardiovascular disease and individual lifestyle factors. The findings are presented through data analysis and visualization methods. Two main research directions were chosen: analyzing the correlation between cardiovascular disease and demographic factors, and exploring the relationship between cardiovascular disease and health factors. The team also employed cluster analysis to identify key factors influencing cardiovascular disease.


## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn
- math
- sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder
- sklearn.cluster.KMeans
- sklearn.decomposition.PCA

## Key Findings
The project yielded several important findings:

### Age and Cardiovascular Disease Prevalence:
There is a significant increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease among individuals aged 50 to 75, as indicated by the distribution in different age categories.

### Lifestyle Factors and Cardiovascular Health:
Unexpectedly, non-smokers outnumber smokers among cardiovascular disease patients, suggesting a potential lack of correlation between smoking and cardiovascular disease in this population. Additionally, engaging in regular exercise appears to be associated with a lower proportion of individuals having cardiovascular disease.

### Cluster Analysis Insights:
Cluster analysis, especially based on lifestyle factors like healthy consumption and fried potato consumption, identifies distinct categories with varying risks of heart disease.

### Population Clustering and Health Factors:
Population clustering using exercise, age, checkup, and general health factors, along with PCA analysis, identifies three categories, with individuals with heart disease mostly concentrated in the second category.
