# MED5018_Group5
This is the final project of Group 5 for MED5018 at the Southern University of Science and Technology. The group members include Chen XiYue, Liu Yuchen, LiuChunfa, and Yang Huanning. 
The project aims to delve into the relationship between cardiovascular disease and individual lifestyle factors, presenting relevant findings through data analysis and visualization methods. The team chose two main research directions: the analysis of the relationship between cardiovascular disease and demographic factors and the analysis of the relationship between cardiovascular disease and health factors. Through cluster analysis, they aim to discover key factors that may influence cardiovascular disease.

  Age and Cardiovascular Disease Prevalence:
  There is a notable increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease among individuals aged 50 to 75, as indicated by the distribution in different age categories.

  Lifestyle Factors and Cardiovascular Health:
  Unexpectedly, non-smokers outnumber smokers among cardiovascular disease patients, suggesting a potential lack of correlation between smoking and cardiovascular disease in this population.
  Engaging in regular exercise appears to be associated with a lower proportion of individuals having cardiovascular disease.

  Health Conditions and Cardiovascular Disease:
  The distribution of individuals with and without heart disease across various health conditions reveals unexpected results, such as a higher prevalence of heart disease among those classified under "good" health.

  Cluster Analysis Insights:
  Cluster analysis, especially based on lifestyle factors like healthy consumption and fried potato consumption, identifies distinct categories with varying risks of heart disease.

  Population Clustering and Health Factors:
  Population clustering using exercise, age, checkup, and general health factors, along with PCA analysis, identifies three categories, with individuals with heart disease mostly concentrated in the second category.
